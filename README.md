# I'm on it!

The I'm on it project is intended to help voluntary organisations with organising their efforts.

- a person (or organisation) registers an event they want to "organise"
- this person is the organiser and adds tasks to the event, and shares the event with people they know
- the people that receive the event link can claim tasks created by the organiser, thus participating in the event
